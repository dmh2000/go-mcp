# client prompt

in directory mcp-client, create a model context protocol client. the client should do the following:
- the client will include a main function and any other functions as needed
- the code will be written using the go language
- the client should use the go standard library for json-rpc
- the client will start the mcp server as a subprocess
- the client will connect to the mcp server using stdio
- the client will send a model context protocol initialization message to the server
- the client will receive the initialization message from the server
- the client will print the contents of the initialization message
- the client will configure itself to call the methods that the mcp server specifies


1. Error Handling Issues:
    x At line 274-282: Using log.Fatalf for the shutdown message is too severe. Should use regular logging
  instead of terminating.
    x Missing error checking in several places in main(), should handle gracefully.
  2. Code Structure:
    x Initialization is duplicated - same InitResponse defined twice (lines 43-49 and 211-217), violating
  DRY principle.
    x The error handling in ReadRequestHeader at line 125 silently sets Seq to 0 if unmarshaling fails.
  3. Security Considerations:
    - RandomString function uses modulo biasing when converting random bytes to charset indices. This
  introduces bias in the random string generation.
    x No max length check for RandomString - could allow excessive memory allocation.
  4. Logging:
    x Inconsistent logging - both log package and direct stderr writes used throughout.
    x Debug logs sent to stderr may interfere with actual stderr output consumers.
    x Logs sensitive information that could contain credentials.
  5. Idiomatic Go Issues:
    x Missing context support - modern Go APIs typically use context for cancellation.
    x Hard-coded constants should be defined as package constants (e.g., charset, log file name).
    x The JSON-RPC 2.0 specifics should be abstracted to dedicated types.
  6. Resource Management:
    - **No rate limiting or timeouts for request handling.**
    x Hardcoded sleep of 500ms during shutdown is arbitrary.
  7. Edge Cases:
    x No handling for very large requests that could cause memory issues.
    x ID field error handling isn't robust (line 124-128).
  8. Maintainability:
    x Server configuration values are hardcoded rather than configured via environment/config.

  The code works but would benefit from addressing these issues for production use.
